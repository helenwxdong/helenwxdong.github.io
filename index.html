<h2> Finance and Website Coordinator</h2>
<h4 style="font-weight:bold"> WATonomous, Spring 2018 </h4>
<p> WATonomous is a student-ran club at the University of Waterloo composed of students who work together to build a self-driving car.
As a member of the finance team, I assisted with budgeting, scheduling and attending meetings, and tracking each team's spending by creating
spreadsheets on Excel for organization. 
</p>
<p> As a member of the Website team, we worked on general updating and maintanence of the website. I assisted with 
creating an SSL Certificate for the website and updating the team members for the term.
WATonomous was one of my favourite clubs to be apart of as it embodies the talents and skills from various different individuals.

<h2> House Council Representative </h2>
<h4 style="font-weight:bold"> Laurier First Year Leadership Program, Fall and Winter 2018 </h4>
<p> House Council is composed of a group of first year students who collaborate in organizing and running events for Wilfrid Laurier University. 
I was chosen to be apart of two councils: off campus students (as I did not live in residence) and Arts Laurier (as art is one of my favourite hobbies outside of school).
</p>
<p> For each event we planned, we were split up and assigned different responsibilities. These can include finance (allocating and tracking spending), 
social media marketing, picking up supplies, and deducing the logistics of the event. The photo on the left is a school-wide event called Hawk Weekend
which I helped host and participate in. It involved a set of mini games that are played by each school residence for points. The event was a 
great success despite the tight time constraint.

<h2> Piano Teacher </h2>
<h4 style="font-weight:bold"> Self Employed, 2017 - 2018 </h4>
<p> In my spare time, I also teach piano to children. I have been playing the instrument for many years and I am responsible for teaching 
them beginner content ranging from music theory to techniques in playing easy songs.
</p>
<p> I have grown alot over this experience as it pushed me to use my skills in new and creative ways in order to make learning piano 
enjoyable and simple for children. It also greatly enhanced my communication, presentation, and collaboration skills.

<h2> Personal Website Made From Scratch </h2>
<h4 style="font-weight:bold"> Spring 2018 </h4>
<p> During summer of 2018, I coded each line of this website from scratch. I always had a passion for art and design and I thought it would be 
a good way to showcase my skills for front-end development instead of searching online for hours for a template I was happy with. Feel free to explore the 
features of my website. You can download a copy of my resume and visit my social medias above, as well as take a look at my hobbies down below. 
</p>
<p> This website utilizes CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for the Google Maps API below.

<h2> Full Stack Java Quiz </h2>
<h4 style="font-weight:bold"> Spring 2017 </h4>
<p> I worked with a mentor to develop a fully functioning full stack quiz that tests the user on their knowledge of basic Java related concepts. 
The quiz will first recieve user's name and display a personal greeting.
It can also catch the exception where the user does not input their name. The quiz then recieves and processes user's answer inputs through forms and displays
their score for the quiz as well as a line of advice. 
</p>
<p> This website utilizes Java, JSP, Spring MVC, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
